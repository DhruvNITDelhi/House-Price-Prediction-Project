# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models and evaluate their accuracy. By comparing various models, we identify the most effective one for this regression task. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives
- Predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.
- Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
- Analyze feature importance and their impact on house prices.

## Dataset
We used publicly available datasets like the [Kaggle House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The dataset contains:
- **Features:** Location, square footage, number of rooms, year built, and more.
- **Target Variable:** Sale price of houses.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Scaled numerical features using standardization.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions.
- Analyzed correlations between features.
- Identified and treated outliers.

### 3. Model Implementation
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost, LightGBM)**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
- **Neural Networks**

### 4. Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters were optimized using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

### 6. Comparison and Results
- Model performances were compared based on evaluation metrics.
- Insights from feature importance analysis were highlighted.

### 7. Deployment (Optional)
The best model can be deployed using **Streamlit** or **Flask** for real-time predictions.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`

## Results
- The **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost** provided the most accurate predictions with the lowest RMSE.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that location and square footage are the most influential factors in predicting house prices.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train models and evaluate results.
4. Optionally, use `app.py` to launch a web interface for predictions.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional features like crime rates, school ratings, and accessibility.
- Experiment with deep learning models for further improvement.
- Deploy the best model as a cloud-based service.
